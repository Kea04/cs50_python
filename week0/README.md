Good Day

My week has been a bit challenging, particularly when it can to learning how to navigate github. I have managed to learn the basic github commands and to create a repository.

I regards to the python learning content and the problem sets I found it to be fairly simple to grasp and get through the work.

I have managed to complete my problem sets and push them to my github repository.
